**NaÃ¯ve Prompt (Basic):**  
"Write a story about smart transportation in a city."

**Output**:  
"ðŸš¦ Smart City, Smooth Ride ðŸš¦
In the futuristic city of Metrovia, transportation was powered by AI. Roads had sensors, traffic lights adjusted in real time, and self-driving electric buses called Autowaves moved like a swarmâ€”changing routes based on demand, weather, and even social media buzz.
Citizens used the Pulse App to suggest improvements, track buses, and earn rewards for walking or biking. The system was so smart, it even rerouted traffic during emergencies and healed cracked roads with smart asphalt.
Metrovia wasnâ€™t just fastâ€”it was kind, green, and built around its people.
"

"The city of Liora faced daily traffic chaos. To fix it, leaders installed smart sensors, adaptive signals, and AI-driven routing. Vehicles, buses, and trains synced with real-time data. Commuters used a single app to plan trips, switch modes, and avoid delays. Roads adjusted lanes during peak hours. Public transport became faster, cleaner, and more reliable. Within months, traffic eased, pollution dropped, and people moved with ease."

**Few-Shot Prompt (2 Examples):**  
"Example 1: Real-time traffic sensors adjust signal timings to reduce congestion.  
Example 2: A mobile app helps commuters choose the fastest route based on live data.  
Now, write a new story about how smart transportation systems improve life in a city."    

**Output**:  
"In the city of Novara, traffic once drained time and energy. Then came smart upgrades: sensors tracked flow, signals adapted instantly, and commuters used an app to plan faster routes. Public transport synced with real-time data, reducing wait times. Roads became smoother, air cleaner, and people reached destinations calmly. Life moved betterâ€”because the city learned to move smart."

**Chain-of-Thought Prompt:**  
Step 1: A city faces daily traffic jams and long commute times.  
Step 2: Smart sensors and GPS data are used to monitor traffic flow.  
Step 3: Signal timings and public transport routes are adjusted dynamically.  
Step 4: Commuters receive live updates and route suggestions.  
Step 5: Write a story combining these steps.   

**Output:**
"The city of Elora struggled with traffic jams and long commutes. To fix this, smart sensors and GPS data began tracking vehicle flow. Signals adjusted in real time, and buses changed routes based on demand. Commuters got live updates and smarter route suggestions. Soon, travel became faster, smoother, and stress-free."
