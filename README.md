### AI Tools Required: 
Copilot


## **Objective**  
- Understand how the same task can be refined into multiple prompting techniques: Zero-shot, Few-shot, Chain-of-Thought.  
- Compare na√Øve vs. basic prompts across different healthcare-related scenarios.  
- Evaluate outputs in terms of **quality, accuracy, and depth**.  


## **Selected Text Scenarios**  
1. Generating a creative story.  
2. Answering a factual question.  
3. Summarizing an article/concept.
4. Explaining a process or concept step-by-step.  
5. Providing advice/recommendations.  


## **Scenario 1: Generating a Creative Story**  
**Na√Øve Prompt (Basic):**  
"Write a story about smart transportation in a city."

**Output**:  
"üö¶ Smart City, Smooth Ride üö¶
In the futuristic city of Metrovia, transportation was powered by AI. Roads had sensors, traffic lights adjusted in real time, and self-driving electric buses called Autowaves moved like a swarm‚Äîchanging routes based on demand, weather, and even social media buzz.
Citizens used the Pulse App to suggest improvements, track buses, and earn rewards for walking or biking. The system was so smart, it even rerouted traffic during emergencies and healed cracked roads with smart asphalt.
Metrovia wasn‚Äôt just fast‚Äîit was kind, green, and built around its people.
"

**Zero-Shot Prompt:**  
"Without any examples, write a short story about how a city improves traffic flow and commuter experience using smart transportation systems."  

**Output**:  
"The city of Liora faced daily traffic chaos. To fix it, leaders installed smart sensors, adaptive signals, and AI-driven routing. Vehicles, buses, and trains synced with real-time data. Commuters used a single app to plan trips, switch modes, and avoid delays. Roads adjusted lanes during peak hours. Public transport became faster, cleaner, and more reliable. Within months, traffic eased, pollution dropped, and people moved with ease."

**Few-Shot Prompt (2 Examples):**  
"Example 1: Real-time traffic sensors adjust signal timings to reduce congestion.
Example 2: A mobile app helps commuters choose the fastest route based on live data.
Now, write a new story about how smart transportation systems improve life in a city."  

**Output**:  
"In the city of Novara, traffic once drained time and energy. Then came smart upgrades: sensors tracked flow, signals adapted instantly, and commuters used an app to plan faster routes. Public transport synced with real-time data, reducing wait times. Roads became smoother, air cleaner, and people reached destinations calmly. Life moved better‚Äîbecause the city learned to move smart."

**Chain-of-Thought Prompt:**  
Step 1: A city faces daily traffic jams and long commute times.
Step 2: Smart sensors and GPS data are used to monitor traffic flow.
Step 3: Signal timings and public transport routes are adjusted dynamically.
Step 4: Commuters receive live updates and route suggestions.
Step 5: Write a story combining these steps.  

**Output**:
"The city of Elora struggled with traffic jams and long commutes. To fix this, smart sensors and GPS data began tracking vehicle flow. Signals adjusted in real time, and buses changed routes based on demand. Commuters got live updates and smarter route suggestions. Soon, travel became faster, smoother, and stress-free."

## **Scenario 2: Answering a Factual Question**  
**Na√Øve Prompt:**  
"How does AI help in diagnosing diseases?"

**Zero-Shot Prompt:**  
"Without any examples, explain how AI assists doctors in identifying illnesses."

**Few-Shot Prompt (2 Examples):**  
"Example 1: AI detects cancer cells from X-ray scans.  
Example 2: AI analyzes blood test results to flag anomalies.  
Now, explain another way AI helps in diagnosing diseases."

**Chain-of-Thought Prompt:**  
Step 1: Doctors need to analyze patient data.  
Step 2: AI can review images, lab reports, and symptoms.  
Step 3: AI highlights abnormalities or patterns.  
Step 4: Doctors confirm diagnosis based on AI suggestions.  
Step 5: Explain this process in detail.

**ChatGPT Response :**  
"AI assists doctors by analyzing medical images, lab results, and patient history to identify potential illnesses early. For example, it can detect cancerous cells in scans or flag abnormal blood results. AI acts as a decision support tool, helping doctors make faster and more accurate diagnoses."

## **Scenario 3: Summarizing an Article/Concept**  
**Na√Øve Prompt:**  
"Summarize an article about AI in healthcare."

**Zero-Shot Prompt:**  
"Without prior examples, summarize a passage that discusses AI applications in hospitals and clinics."

**Few-Shot Prompt (2 Examples):**  
"Example 1: AI improves patient monitoring and reduces errors.  
Example 2: AI accelerates drug discovery processes.  
Now summarize another passage describing AI in healthcare."

**Chain-of-Thought Prompt:**  
Step 1: Identify the main points of the article.  
Step 2: Focus on AI applications in hospitals.  
Step 3: Highlight benefits such as efficiency, accuracy, and patient care.  
Step 4: Combine points into a concise summary.

**ChatGPT Response :**  
"AI in healthcare is transforming hospitals by improving patient monitoring, assisting in accurate diagnosis, and enhancing operational efficiency. It also helps in drug discovery and personalized patient care, reducing errors and improving outcomes."

## **Scenario 4: Providing Advice/Recommendations**  
**Na√Øve Prompt:**  
"Give advice on using AI in healthcare."

**Zero-Shot Prompt:**  
"Without examples, suggest how hospitals can implement AI for better patient care."

**Few-Shot Prompt (2 Examples):**  
"Example 1: Use AI to monitor patient vitals in real-time.  
Example 2: Implement AI chatbots to answer patient queries.  
Now give three more ways hospitals can use AI effectively."

**Chain-of-Thought Prompt:**  
"Step 1: Identify hospital challenges.  
Step 2: Think of AI solutions for each challenge.  
Step 3: Suggest practical implementations.  
Step 4: Explain benefits of each solution.  
Step 5: Provide recommendations."

**ChatGPT Response :**  
"Hospitals can implement AI by monitoring patient vitals in real-time, using AI chatbots for patient support, and employing predictive analytics to prevent complications. Additionally, AI can optimize staff scheduling and resource allocation, ensuring better patient care and operational efficiency."
